# Style Settings

> Settings specially made by the *theme developer* of the theme that you have installed (if it's not the default one) that lets you change the way the theme shows

> [!warning] Heads up
> Not **all** themes have *Style Settings* integrated on their themes. If you feel like a theme needs a certain style setting, you can go to the theme repository and ask for it by creating a new issue.

It's as simple as it gets, there could be a set of settings that you can change so that some elements of the theme appear the way you want them to, and not the other way around.
