# M.I.S.S. - W. - Explanation

> [!note]- "Miss-placement" between the **`M`anagement** and the **`I`nbox**
> As you may have seen already, the **`I`nbox** appears above **`M`anagement**. This layout was the original, and still is, but if you want to have the **`M`anagement** folder appear above the **`I`nbox**, you can rename the folder to **`Â· M`anagement**

There isn't an order that you need to follow between the different folders or to use the folders a particular way. As said [[README|before]], this vault aims to be as flexible as possible, that's why (to some degree) every folder is up for himself.

So I'm going to explain the purpose of every folder *individually*:

- [[Management]]
- [[Inbox]]
- [[Slip-box]]
- [[Source]]
- [[Workbench]]

> [!tip] 
> All this information is store in one folder inside the [[Slip-box]] (something that I personally discourage to do if you don't know what you're doing) in order for you to erase all this tutorial easily in case you don't need it anymore.

Finally, there are 2 files: `Home` and`Issues`, they both serve the same purpose as the ones of any [[Workbench#^9607d0|project]].

> [!warning] Important information about the CSS
> This vault provides 2 snippets: `dvjs` and `home-page`. This snippets allows you to see certain things a certain way. 
> This `CSS` snippets are also attached to the current theme (`Ukiyo`), but you can also use another theme, just don't forget to get the snippets provided here, otherwise some things will look broken.

## Additional Information

You have finished reading all the documentation that I have provided you to understand how this vault/workflow works, but there are some stuff that either I didn't give a concise explanation or didn't even say anything.

That's because, for a beginner, maybe this elements aren't what you need right now or is complicated enough for me to write it on another note. That's why we have the following list, that will display the **MOC**s to all the tools that I didn't explain previously:

- [[Plugins]]
- [[External Tools]]
