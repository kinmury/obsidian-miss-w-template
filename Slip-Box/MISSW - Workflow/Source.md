Here lays all the external data and information that you collect over time and that is helps you better represent and explain the ideas that you are storing/building on your vault.

If you open the folder, you'll see that there are 3 sub-folders:
- **Attachments** - All your photos, all the files that you drag into a note will come here (*even your PDFs*, will talk about it shortly). Here should only stay visual files (photos, graphs, ...) or data that is different from a test file (PDF, EPUB, ...). This kinds of files goes on the next sub-folder:
- **Documents** - Here will stay all your PDFs, EPUBs and any other file that contains a lot of text and from which you obtain your information.
	- The main goal of keeping those sort of files is for you to make a reference to said files, its author and source of information.
	- This topic of *making reference* is (to my surprise) pretty big and important, since whenever you need to give any official documentation to, let say, your teacher, you'll net to write down on your **Bibliography** section all the documents that you have reference while creating said essay.
		- Here comes to play another app that is not Obsidian: **Zotero**, but will talk about it in another section ([[External Tools]]).
- **Templates** - Here are all the *templates* that you vault uses, here you will recognise 2 templates already: `Default Report Note` and `Default Document Note`, but the other ones are still new.
	- ==Warning== - Please, do **not** change these files unless you are sure what you are doing, since changing them means changing the way said templates work and (sure enough) break the workflow.
	- If you open one of these 2 files, you'll see that there is all the information that is copied to the new notes you create on the [[Inbox#^3fa0b8|Report Notes]] and the [[Inbox#^123252|Document Notes]].
	- Also you'll see something in between these `<%%>`, that the syntax for a plugin called [[Templater]], will talk about it in another time ([[Plugins]]).
	- Long story short, whenever you need to create a template to stop writing repetitive set of texts, you can create one here and apply it (`ALT+E`) to the current note
		- Be careful when you do this, you may end up using the wrong template and changing things (in this case, the name of the file) or executing code (we'll take about it on the very next section [[Workbench]]) that you didn't need to. Just make sure that you choose the correct template and you'll be fine ðŸ˜‹.
