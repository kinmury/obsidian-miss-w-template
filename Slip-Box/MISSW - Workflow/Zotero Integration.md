# Zotero Integration

This will make more sense if first you know that [[Zotero]] is and what is used for.

> This plugin connects your [[Zotero]] reference database to your vault, so that you could create reference with ease.

This is also a lot more specific to people who does research or needs to make a really huge and important project for his degree or masters. So if you aren't on that level yet or you feel like you don't need it, you probably don't.
