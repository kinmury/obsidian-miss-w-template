# Templater

This is the second most powerful plugin of this vault. 

> Not only you can apply a template to a new or already created note, but also lets you execute code while you apply said template.

Thanks to this plugin, not only we can stop writing manually all the repetitive stuff (yup... a template) but also can execute code that changes stuff about the files, like their names.

A more advanced example would be the [[Create New Project]] template, that doesn't really do anything to the note that is being applied to, but it creates a hole new set of files and directories, with already created content on them (as you probably have tried out by now).

As it happens with [[Dataview]], this plugin is as powerful as the programming knowledge of the user. But even thought you don't have said knowledge, you can still use it for a lot of stuff and, also, you can always learn how to use the advanced feature that it has either reading the documentation or learning through the example templates that you can find either here, on this vault, or the [Obsidian Discord Server](https://obsidian.md/community) channel that its dedicated to talk about how this plugin can be used and applied to different contexts.
