# Page Review

This plugin is simple, but quite powerful for quick inspections. Whenever you are on the graph view, local graph view, or you have a link of a note inside your actual note, you can hover over it with your mouse and press `CTRL`^[`CMD` if you are a MAC user, but you already know that ðŸ˜‰].

By doing so, a small window will pop out showing you all the content that the note has, without the need to open said note. This is useful when working with `MOC`s (*cough cough* [[Home]], [[Issues]] *cough cough*).
