# File Recovery

I'm sure you know the purpose of this plugin is, and I'm sure I don't need to stress how important this plugin can become on desperate times (when you lost some changes for some reason).

Every 5 minutes (this can be change on the core plugin setting) Obsidian takes a local snapshot of the note that you are currently working on, and it saves it for a period of time (a week by default, once again, you can change it in the settings).

Whenever something happens and some of your progress is lost, or maybe you liked a previous version of the note more than the actual one, you can open the snapshots (there isn't a short cut attached to the command, so you need to search for it on the [[Command Palette]]) and there choose the note that you want to see it's history. Once you are there, choose the wanted snapshot and apply it.

Even though this is really useful, you shouldn't really on it as your backup for your vault. You should use a backup system (at least one kind, but I've seen people using multiple backup tools for the same files/vault) like [[GitHub]]^[Thats the one that I use, along with a local copy once in a while]
