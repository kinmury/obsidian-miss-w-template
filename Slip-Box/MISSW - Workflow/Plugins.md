# Plugins

In Obsidian there are 2 kinds of plugins:
- **Core Plugins** - The ones that build in once you install Obsidian
- **Community Plugins** - The ones that other people, different developers than the ones that are building and developing Obsidian, have created and implemented using the Obsidian `API`.

## Core Plugins

If you go to the settings, either clicking over the `Settings Icon` on the bottom right corner of the window or using the command `CTRL+,`, you'll open the Obsidian Settings. There will display 3 sections:
- **Options** - General option on how the vault is configured
- **Core Plugins** - The specific settings for each core plugin that is activated
- **Community Plugins** - The specific settings for each community plugin that is installed

I recommend you to go through every setting, not to memorise it, but to know what you can change and adapt to your liking. If you are new to Obsidian, I would suggest to not change any settings if you installed this template. Instead, create a new **empty vault** and experiment with it, break everything if needed. The configuration that you have on one vault doesn't affect on a preview or new one, since the settings are *not* sync between vaults.

> [!tip]- Save configuration between vaults
> If you want to keep a certain configuration that you made on one vault, with all the themes and plugins that you have installed, simply go to the original vault (where those settings are) and copy the hole `.obdisian` folder. This folder contains everything that is needed to configure the vault. 

Inside the **Core Plugins** you'll only see the ones that are activated (the ones that I use and choose to remain active on the template). If you want to see all the core plugins available and turn them on, go to: `Settings > Options > Core Plugins`. There you'll see the list with all the core plugins that are implemented in the Obsidian version that's installed^[Over time, the developers will like add more and more core plugins if they see it fit, but you'll see if they add anything new on the `Release Note` every time you update your Local Obsidian Version].

Here is the explanation for each **core plugin**:
- [[Backlinks]]
- [[Command Palette]]
- [[File Recovery]]
- [[Page Preview]]
- [[Quick Switcher]]

Once again, these are the core plugins that **I** use and recommend other to use as well, this doesn't mean that you must use them all, or don't use the other plugins that aren't turned on. Eventually you'll find your own set of tool that better suit your needs. And for that, you need to *experiment* and *break things* more times that you think.

## Community Plugins

Now, don't freak out, there are over $687 \text{ plugins}$ at the time of writing this documentation. **Spoiler Alert:** You *won't* be using all of them. There is a meme running on the [Obsidian Discord Server](https://obsidian.md/community) which says: *One does not simply use all features of Obsidian*. And... it actually make sense, since you don't really need all of them, or maybe you do, I don't know ðŸ¤£.

Moving out of the memes, let's dive in into the community plugins installed in this vault:
- [[Advanced New File]]
- [[Advanced Tables]]
- [[Dataview]]
- [[Editor Syntax Highlight]]
- [[Homepage]]
- [[Kanban]]
- [[Obsidian42 - BRAT]]
- [[Style Settings]]
- [[Templater]]
- [[TikZJax]]
- [[Typewritter Scroll]]
- [[Zotero Integration]]

> [!tip] Recommendation
> The explanation that I give to every single one of this plugin is a summary of the full potential of each plugin.

> I highly recommend you to visit each one of their GitHub repositories in order to find their respective documentation an learn more about how to properly use them and to understand how they work at their fullest.
