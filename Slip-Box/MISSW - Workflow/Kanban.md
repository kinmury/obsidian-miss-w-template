# Kanban

This is already explained [[Management|here]], this plugins shows information inside notes, and this notes are positioned inside a bunch of list that represents some important information about said notes.

You can create as much Kanbans as you want (I personally create a Kanban per-project, where I put the important events (not the issues, there is already a "`hand-made-kanban`" for that on the project folder)) and put as much events/tasks in there as you want.

And thanks to the great job of the developer, you can *drag and drop* said notes from one list to another, making its use much more smooth and practical.
