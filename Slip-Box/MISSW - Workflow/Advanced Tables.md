# Advanced Tables

> This will help you edit tables with ease

> [!warning] Outdated
> Sadly, this plugin hasn't been updated for a long time. At the time of writing this documentation, the last updated was on `02/04/2022`, meaning it has a lot of issues that aren't being addressed and hasn't even being adapted to the new `v1.0.0` version of Obsidian.

I'll explain its functionality in hope someday the developer/s of the plugin decide to update it.  The main idea is to use `TAB` and `Enter` whenever you are in a cell of a table to move from that cell no the next one, or the next row. If you want to get out of the table, you need to press `SHIFT+Enter` to do so.
