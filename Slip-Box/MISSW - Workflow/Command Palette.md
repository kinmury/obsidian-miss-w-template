# Command Palette

You've been using this tool for a while now (if you have tried it out while reading the documentation): By pressing `CTRL+P`, a prompt will show up where it shows a list of all the available commands that you can use on the vault, given the plugins that are installed and turned on.

You can search the command by typing its action or scrolling until you find it. The interesting part of this prompt is that is also shows you the shortcut that it has (if one has been given to said command in the settings previously). So, in case you are using a command pretty often, you should remember the shortcut and use it instead, since its faster that way.

And, additionally, if you are using a command quite often but it doesn't have a command, I suggest you to consider the possibility to add a shortcut for it. To do so, you need to go to `Settings > Hotkeys`, search for the command, pressing the $\bigoplus$ sign and execute the shortcut that you want to attach to said command. Once that's done, you are ready to go ðŸ˜„.
