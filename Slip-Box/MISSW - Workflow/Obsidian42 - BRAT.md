# Obsidian42 - BRAT

This plugin shouldn't been here (thats why is the only plugin that it's turn off), but I still wanted to include it on the template.

> If there is a plugin that is on beta, you can download and test it using this plugin

This plugins serve the purpose to install a plugin that is on beta, test it, and review it to the developer. If you are someone that are interesting on beta-testing a plugin, you can use this plugin to install said plugin and review it/create issues that you find about it on the associated repository.

But, if you aren't someone that is interested on being a beta-tester, or you don't know much about programming and how this kind of thing works, you can go ahead and erase this plugin from your list of installed plugins.
