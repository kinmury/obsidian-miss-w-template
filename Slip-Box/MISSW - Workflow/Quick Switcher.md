# Quick Switcher

Finally, we have the Quick Switcher. I use it way too much. If you press `CTRL+O`, a new prompt similar to the [[Command Palette]] will show up, but instead of showing you all the commands that the vault has installed and turned on, it displays all the notes that your vault has (or could have, if you have link to notes that aren't yet created).

That's it, that's the plugin 😁
