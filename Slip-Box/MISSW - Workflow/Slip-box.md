# Slip-Box

Next on the list, the **Slip-Box**, the place where your well defined notes will be store for the rest of your vaults life.

As you may have seen, this folder doesn't have any sub-folders (yes, I'm not counting the documentation folder), and that is because you "*don't*" really need to use folders at all.

As said before, this vault uses a simplified version of [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten#:~:text=A%20Zettelkasten%20\(German%3A%20%22slip,such%20as%20numbers%20and%20tags.). The main idea behind this workflow is the following:

> **Create Links between Notes**

Maybe I'm over-simplifying this (since I'm learning how to use said workflow myself) but the idea is to make as many *meaningful* connections between ideas (notes) as possible.

By following this workflow, you may need to create more than one `Document Note` for each `Report Note`, since the best way to organise and, later on, use your knowledge, is by creating **Atomic Notes**.

> [!callout] Atomic Notes
> An *atomic note* is a note which content is only one idea (or a small number of ideas put together) explained as precisely as possible

Lets put it this way: **Let's play `LEGO`**. Thing of every little piece of block that `LEGO` has, there are pieces as small as a $1 \times 1$, other pieces are long but thin ones ($1 \times 4$), other are a littler bigger ($4 \times 4$). 

Every piece is independent from one another, but they share the same property: *They can be united (linked) together*. By doing so, with enough little pieces, you can create a construction, and with some constructions, you can create an even bigger one (and so on). 

The same thing (maybe (sadly) not so easily) happens following the Zettelkasten method. You create your own pieces of `LEGO` (*Aotmic Notes*) and, as time passes, you have a bunch of pieces (notes) that are connected. Maybe you see a connection from one group of notes to another (even if that connection is made by just one singular note of said group), and that alone unlocks a new way of seeing those ideas with a different perspective.

Eventually, you end up with a construction, *your construction*, that will serve you as your knowledge base, that you can use for whatever reason you see fit: Creating an essay for a project, write a book with all your ideas (ideas don't need to be just "real world" ideas, they maybe are fictional and help you with your writing carrier, who knows), create your own structure that helps you build your business on personal project that you can share with others, maybe you have a `DnD` campaign so big that you need to store every detail so that everything made sense whenever is needed.

Pretty much the possibilities are infinite or... at least, where your imagination lets you. At the end of the day, your vault is whatever you want it to be, and the `Slip-Box` is the base of *your* knowledge, your imagination, your ideas, your thoughts, your dreams... anything really.

## Structure of the Slip-Box

Going back to the documentation, the slip-box could be structured in 2 ways:
- **MOCs** - ==Recommend== - Even thought you will try to make all the meaningful connections between your notes, sometimes you may need to have some sort of `index` between all those ideas. That's where `MOC`s come into play.
	- A *Map Of Content* it's just a note that contains links to another notes. As simple as that: You just create a note and create all the links that you see fit/have some idea/theme in common. (This kinds of notes will be used further in the workflow)
- **Folder** - *Not Recommended* - If you want to use folders, by all means, go ahead, as I said before: Your vault, your rules. But I encourage you to, at least, give it a try and use **MOC**s for a bit. They are the same thing, but instead on putting all the stuff into a folder, you write it down on a note (pretty much the same thing if you think about it)
