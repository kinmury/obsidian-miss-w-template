# Advanced New File

> This plugins allows you to create a new file anywhere in the vault through your keyboard using 2 prompts.

To start the process, you use the command `ALT+SHIFT+N` and the first prompt shows up. You need to choose which folder will be created said note. Once you've done that, another prompt will show up, asking you to write the name of the new note. 

If there is no issue, the new note will be created on the folder that you've specified before. But beware that it could not work, and an error could pop out. This only happens when you try to create a note that already exists, in which chase nothing will happen, and a notice on the top right corner of the windows telling about this error.
