## Main Objectives of the Vault Template

This Vault was developed by a user with programming knowledge, a Computer Engineer student to be precise. This means that the design of the Vault is affected by the workflow of a programming/engineer student.

Also this **doesn't** mean that this Vault is made for a specific kind of person, with certain kind of abilities and knowledge. On the contrary, this Vaults first priority is to serve as a tool, as easy to use and flexible as possible, in order to accomplish difficult tasks and projects with ease.

This vault tries^[This works for me, but maybe not for you, you have to find out and adapt the Vault to your needs if necessary] to solve the following issues:
- **Management/Organisation/Order** - This point is divided into 2 related categories:
	- *Knowledge Management* - As every good vault should aim, this vault follows a "note structure/organisation", being a simplified Zettelkasten this case. Even thought it's a very simplified/modified version of a true Zettelkasten, it ends up being the same in the end.
		- ==Note== - Even thought I recommend following this method of note organisation, it doesn't mean you are forced to use it. You can still use this template for any other `PKM`, and maybe you will need to make some modification to said template. As said at the beginning, the vault aims to be as flexible as possible.
	- *Task Management* - There will be 2 tasks categories which will be managed "separately":
		- <ins>Main Tasks</ins> - The global events that doesn't fit into any project (or it isn't as precise as a project issue may need to be), such as general day to day events, meetings, repetitive activities, hobbies...
		- <ins>Project Tasks</ins> - All the issues and tasks related specifically to one singular project. These tasks are managed aside from the previews category of tasks because of the direct effect they have over said project.
- **Centralisation** - In a number of times I had the need of creating more than one vault in order to develop a certain project/practice in order to avoid mixing the notes of said project and the notes of my main vault.
	- This not only became repetitive but also tedious, since doing creating a new vault meant to copy all the appearance and plugins configuration into the rest of the vaults, and the moment some theme or plugin pushed an update to their respective repositories, meant that I had to go to every single one of the created vault and update the local version of said plugin/theme.
	- Even thought that you can still have all the notes at the same place with the correct note templates/configuration, I still felt the need to have a special place (folder) for every project, in case I need to export said project or change it all together.
	- That's where the `W` comes in (more information about the meaning of the letters at the end of this `Readme.md`), hitting two birds with one stone.
- **Data Base** - Since I'm still a student (and probably also when I start working) I need a place where I can structure all the files (`PDF`, slides, whatever may be) that the college/institution is giving me, or that I find on the internet that helps me further understand the concepts that I'm studying.

At the end, this vault template is aiming to be as simple and flexible as possible, providing the user with a set of tools as small as possible, just to be able to accomplish interesting/complex objectives.
