# M.I.S.S. - W. - Explanation

> [!note]- "Miss-placement" between the **`M`anagement** and the **`I`nbox**
> As you may have seen already, the **`I`nbox** appears above **`M`anagement**. This layout was the original, and still is, but if you want to have the **`M`anagement** folder appear above the **`I`nbox**, you can rename the folder to **`Â· M`anagement**

There isn't an order that you need to follow between the different folders or to use the folders a particular way. As said [[README|before]], this vault aims to be as flexible as possible, that's why (to some degree) every folder is up for himself.

So I'm going to explain the purpose of every folder *individually*:
- [[Management]]
- [[Inbox]]
- [[Slip-box]]
- [[Source]]
- [[Workbench]]

As a final note, all this information is store in one folder inside the [[Slip-box]] (something that I personally discourage to do if you don't know what you're doing) in order for you to erase all this tutorial easily in case you don't need it anymore.
