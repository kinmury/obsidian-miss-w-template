# Management

This folders serves the purpose to ==manager== all the **main tasks** that you need to do throughout a period of time (or not, maybe you'll still be doing `X` tasks indefensibly).

There are a lot of ways to manager all this tasks: using a Calendar plugin, Kanban plugin, Task plugin, Dataview plugin, not using a single plugin and just using the notes as they present themselves, maybe a mix of them or you maybe don't even need Obsidian to manage said tasks (or you already have a system that serves this purpose outside Obsidian, in which case I would think twice before moving out of said system if you aren't yet comfortable using Obsidian).

In the case of this vault, we will use a combination of different methods whenever it's needed. In this particular case (folder), we'll only use the Kanban plugin.

For those who doesn't know what a Kanban is, it's a set of vertical set of lists where you place a bunch of "notes" with the task/information about the task that it needs to be done. Each vertical lists represents a relevant information about the notes that it contains and, more often than note, it represent the stage at which the tasks at hand had reach at the time you are looking at it.

There are a lot of Kanban displays/configurations, being the `TO DO`, `DOING` and `DONE` the most basic one, and a classic. I propose a similar configuration, but with extra steps:
- **`BACKLOG`** - Here are all the tasks that doesn't have a certain deadline but, eventually, you need to do and incorporate it to the already established tasks.
- **`TO DO`** - All the tasks that have a deadline, but you didn't start to work on them, are listed here. Once you have made some progress on it^[To be fair, you need to move it to the next stage once you have started to work on the task, but I'll explain later why you shouldn't care so much about which place your tasks is at every time] you can move it to the next stage.
- **`IN-PROGRESS`**^[It's the same as `DOING`, but I personally like more the `IN-PROGRESS` tag, if you want the other one, feel free to change it ðŸ˜‰] - The task is being worked on, but it hasn't being finished yet, maybe you didn't have enough time to do it, or you need for something to happen in order for you to resume the work. What ever may be, it stays here until otherwise.
- **`Review`** - This is an optional stage. Not all tasks need to necessarily pass thought this stage, nor any other for that matter, but if there is a case where some review is needed over a task, either you want to make sure you did your task right, or any other individual (maybe some friend, a college, a supervise, or even your boss, whoever may be) needs to give you the "thumbs up".
- **`DONE`** - Finally, the biggest list of them all: *The finished tasks storage*. Once a task is here, you can already forgive that it even existed at the first place and start working on the rest of the task.

As you can see, the idea of the Kanban is pretty simple, but there are a few things that I want to clarify one last time:
- ==**Don't stress about the amount of tasks that you have to do**== - One of the biggest problem that I have found using any task management system (and also seen in other people) is that either you become *too focused* on the mission to clear out the Kanban or you *freeze out* because of the amount of tasks that needs to be done.
	- The Kanban (or any other task management system) is just a tool for you to use, not for it to use/consume you. I personally don't really watch over it more that 5 minutes a day, just so that I can remember where I left my previous work session and, sometimes, I'll spend a good amount of time organising all my tasks. But once that is done, I just use it as a tool (because... that's what it is... a tool ðŸ˜„) to guide my focus and to not forget an important task. 
- **You don't need to move all the cards "dynamically"** - By this I mean that you don't need to move a task from `TO DO` to  `IN-PROGRESS` every time you start a task. I personally just move it whenever I didn't have time to finish said task or I need to move to another more relevant task. And, most of the times, my tasks move from `TO DO` to `DONE` directly.
- **You don't need to move the cards throughout all stages** - Not all tasks needs to be reviews, nor all tasks need to pass first through the `BACKLOG` stage if there is an already defined deadline.
- **Create your own stages/Kanban** - I just showed you my Kanban configuration. This doesn't mean that you have to stick with it if it isn't for you. I recommend to use it if you are new to Kanban (or any management system at all) just so that you get the idea of how tasks are seen and worked using this system. Once you have some experience and/or you don't find this configuration suitable for your needs, you'll move out to use other systems or create your own configuration.
	- I highly recommend creating your own system/configuration, **but** *only* when you have acquired a good amount of experience. If you start creating systems before using an already created/demonstrated system/configuration, you'll find yourself disappointed because it doesn't work as expected.
